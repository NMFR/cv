					<p>I worked with Nuno for several months at Deliveroo. Our team focused on delivering abstractions for deciding which primitives to run workloads on, networking and databases. Nuno was exceptional at delivering results and was behind some great initiatives which largely helped our monitoring posture. He lead the charge in investigating optimizations to our autoscaling strategies, built a non-urgent but high priority alerting system, changed our development workflow to make more use of devcontainers with VS Code (which significantly improved setup time), significantly improved our database monitoring with custom tooling and became our go-to Kubernetes expert. Nuno has a keen focus on terse but high quality code and likes to take a data driven approach to decision making, which makes him a great candidate for discussion around key decisions. It was great working with Nuno - he&#x27;s an excellent addition to any team!</p>

Nuno engages well with customers and other stakeholders, showing humility and compassion. He quickly became a part of our team, showed high degree of initiative and regularly solicited feedback.
