                <p>I worked with Nuno for several months at Deliveroo. Our team focused on delivering abstractions for deciding which primitives to run workloads on, networking and databases. Nuno was exceptional at delivering results and was behind some great initiatives which largely helped our monitoring posture. He lead the charge in investigating optimizations to our autoscaling strategies, built a non-urgent but high priority alerting system, changed our development workflow to make more use of devcontainers with VS Code (which significantly improved setup time), significantly improved our database monitoring with custom tooling and became our go-to Kubernetes expert. Nuno has a keen focus on terse but high quality code and likes to take a data driven approach to decision making, which makes him a great candidate for discussion around key decisions. It was great working with Nuno - he's an excellent addition to any team!</p>

                <p>Nuno is an experienced engineer who has been a pleasure to work with. He has a combination of qualities valuable for any engineering team or project: broad technical expertise, good people skills, and passion towards sharing his knowledge with others. He showed ability to contribute to and lead projects with high degree of ambiguity, independently learning a new problem space and proactively reaching out for guidance when necessary. Nuno engages well with customers and other stakeholders, showing humility and compassion. He quickly became a part of our team, showed high degree of initiative and regularly solicited feedback.</p>

                <p>Nuno carried the Frames product like no one else. From System Architecture to Quality Assurance, he handled the stack and everyone working with it with an impressive attention to detail and maintainability. Making sure the system scales and correctly responds the the rapid evolution of features is a number one priority that makes the life, as Nuno's manager, very easy. Highly recommended.</p>

                <p>Nuno is one of the best software engineers that I have worked with. He is highly dedicated, creative and intelligent and as his team leader, I always trusted that he would always present the best solution for our customer. He is a great team member, always available to help and coach other team members, even if it requires an extra effort. Despite his great skills, Nuno is very humble and he is always trying to learn new things. Nuno is a person that every project manager wants in his team. I feel very privileged to have met Nuno and to have worked with him, it was a very enriching experience.</p>

                <p>Nuno is THE BEST software engineer I have ever had the pleasure of working with. Period. He is the best! We worked on two big BPM projects. One of the projects was an award winning IBM BPM Application for the Insurance industry. Probably the most advanced IBM BPM application worldwide (I would bet on it). Nuno was the mastermind behind that awesome piece of technology. Top notch! He knows everything about software, architecture, programming languages, he is incredibly talented, he coaches young developers, he loves his code, he loves quality, he breathes software, and best of all he is funny as hell, the type that brings up the vibe of a team and that makes you want to go to work the next day. I recommend him unconditionally to any Software Architect role, any day. He's the best. Trust me, he's the man! I would hire him tomorrow without a blink.</p>

                <p>Nuno is a highly skilled IT professional, a world-class developer. There are no unreachable goals, and everything he delivers is developed with robust solutions for complex problems. He is technically the best IT professional I ever worked.

Extremely productive and intelligent with strong architecture analysis skills. He is always available to help his colleagues and make us learn and evolve as professionals.
