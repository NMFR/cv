Nuno was the mastermind behind that awesome piece of technology. Top notch! He knows everything about software, architecture, programming languages, he is incredibly talented, he coaches young developers, he loves his code, he loves quality, he breathes software, and best of all he is funny as hell, the type that brings up the vibe of a team and that makes you want to go to work the next day. I recommend him unconditionally to any Software Architect role, any day. He's the best. Trust me, he's the man! I would hire him tomorrow without a blink.",
