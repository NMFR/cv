      I worked with Nuno for several months at Deliveroo.
      Our team focused on delivering abstractions for deciding which primitives to run workloads on, networking and databases.
      Nuno was exceptional at delivering results and was behind some great initiatives which largely helped our monitoring posture.
      He lead the charge in investigating optimizations to our autoscaling strategies, built a non-urgent but high priority alerting system,
      changed our development workflow to make more use of devcontainers with VS Code (which significantly improved setup time),
      significantly improved our database monitoring with custom tooling and became our go-to Kubernetes expert.
      Nuno has a keen focus on terse but high quality code and likes to take a data driven approach to decision making,
      which makes him a great candidate for discussion around key decisions.
      It was great working with Nuno - he's an excellent addition to any team!

      Nuno is an experienced engineer who has been a pleasure to work with.
      He has a combination of qualities valuable for any engineering team or project:
      broad technical expertise, good people skills, and passion towards sharing his knowledge with others.
      He showed ability to contribute to and lead projects with high degree of ambiguity,
      independently learning a new problem space and proactively reaching out for guidance when necessary.
      Nuno engages well with customers and other stakeholders, showing humility and compassion.
      He quickly became a part of our team, showed high degree of initiative and regularly solicited feedback.

      Nuno carried the Frames product like no one else. From System Architecture
      to Quality Assurance, he handled the stack and everyone working with it with an
      impressive attention to detail and maintainability. Making sure the system scales
      and correctly responds the the rapid evolution of features is a number one priority
      that makes the life, as Nuno's manager, very easy. Highly recommended.

      Nuno is one of the best software engineers that I have worked with. He
      is highly dedicated, creative and intelligent and as his team leader, I always
      trusted that he would always present the best solution for our customer. He is
      a great team member, always available to help and coach other team members, even
      if it requires an extra effort. Despite his great skills, Nuno is very humble
      and he is always trying to learn new things. Nuno is a person that every project
      manager wants in his team. I feel very privileged to have met Nuno and to have
      worked with him, it was a very enriching experience.

      Nuno is an highly motivated and focused developer but this is not enough
      for him ! He is also good in gathering business requirement, support, troubleshooting
      and everything else Murphy laws can throw in a project.

      Nuno is THE BEST software engineer I have ever had the pleasure of working
      with. Period. He is the best! We worked on two big BPM projects. One of the projects
      was an award winning IBM BPM Application for the Insurance industry. Probably
      the most advanced IBM BPM application worldwide (I would bet on it). Nuno was
      the mastermind behind that awesome piece of technology. Top notch! He knows everything
      about software, architecture, programming languages, he is incredibly talented,
      he coaches young developers, he loves his code, he loves quality, he breathes
      software, and best of all he is funny as hell, the type that brings up the vibe
      of a team and that makes you want to go to work the next day. I recommend him
      unconditionally to any Software Architect role, any day. He's the best. Trust
      me, he's the man! I would hire him tomorrow without a blink.

      Nuno is a highly skilled IT professional, a world-class developer. There
      are no unreachable goals, and everything he delivers is developed with robust
      solutions for complex problems. He is technically the best IT professional I ever
      worked. He is always ready to learn and improve his knowledge, and transfer that
      to every team colleague. Actively helps in creating a good working environment.
    name: Daniel Moura, Manager @ KPMG

      It was an immense experience working with Nuno. One of the best professionals
      I have ever worked with. He is the real deal. Extremely productive and intelligent
      with strong architecture analysis skills. He is always available to help his colleagues
      and make us learn and evolve as professionals. This kind of availability is extremely
      rare. On the personal level... the guy must be the most well-humored IT professional
      on the planet! :)
